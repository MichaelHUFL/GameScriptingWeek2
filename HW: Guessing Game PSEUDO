// Functions
- Computer instantiates random integer between 0 and 100.
- Store random integer in computerNumber.
- Set all Integers to defaults (Ints = 0 / Bools = false).

If loopFinish is false
	If currentAttempt is <= 7
		- Prompt user input "Choose a Number Between 0 - 100"
		- User input -> userNumber
		
		If userNumber = computerNumber
			- Boolean hasWon is set to true
			- Boolean loopFinish is set to true
			- Break loop
		Else if userNumber != computerNumber
			- currentAttempt +1
			- Prompt user "Nope! Try again!"

	Else if currentAttempt > 7
		- Boolean hasWon is set to false
 		- Boolean loopFinish is set to true
 		- Break loop

Else if loopFinish is true
	If currentAttempt > 7
		- Prompt user "You ran out of attempts!"
	If hasWon is true
		- Prompt user "Wow! You got it right!"

- Prompt User "Play Again? (Y/N)"
- User input -> playAgain

	If playAgain = "Y"
		- Set all Integers to defaults (Ints = 0 / Bools = false)
		- Return to loop function
	Else if playAgain = "N"
 		- Prompt user "Thanks for playing!"
	Else if neither
		- Prompt user "Invalid Option! Choose Y/N"
		- User input -> playAgain
