1.Convert a user-input into all caps, print the result.
-------------------------------------------------------
Initialize string lowercaseSentence

Prompt user "Enter a sentence in lowercase:"
	Input lowercaseSentence

Loop through lowercaseSentence letter-by-letter
	If letter is between lowercase A and lowercase Z
		lowercaseSentence letter -32
		Next letter

Print lowercaseSentence to console

2. Have user input two numbers, add them together and print the result.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Integer firstNumber
Initialize Integer secondNumber
Intialize Integer sum

Prompt user "What is the first number?"
	Input firstNumber
If input is NOT a number
	Default to 0; Log debug "Invalid number, defaulted to 0."

Prompt user "What is the second number?"
	Input secondNumber
If input is NOT a number
	Default to 0; Log debug "Invalid number, defaulted to 0."

sum = firstNumber + secondNumber

Output sum to console

3. Get an unknown amount of numbers from the user and add them together, print out the result.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Boolean isFinished
Initialize Integer sum
Initialize Char choice

If Boolean isFinished is false
	Prompt user "What number would you like to add?"
	Input number into temporary variable (tempVar)
	sum = sum + tempVar
	Prompt user "Would you like to add another number?"
	Input Char choice; Loop until isFinished is true
Else if Boolean isFinished is true
	Output sum to console

If Char choice is Y
	Bool isFinished stays false
Else
	Bool isFinished change to true

4. Have the user define a maximum whole number, print out a random number between 0 and their number. Allow the user to play again or quit.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Integer maxNumber
Initialize Integer randomNumber
Initialize Boolean isFinished
Initialize Char choice

If Boolean isFinished is false
	Prompt user "Enter the max number you desire"
	Input maxNumber
If maxNumber <= 0
	Debug log "Invalid number"; Default maxNumber = 10
	randomNumber = RANDOM between 0 and maxNumber
	print to console randomNumber
	Prompt user "Would you like to do another?"
	Input Char choice; Loop until isFinished is true
Else if Boolean isFinished is true
	Print to console "Thanks for playing!";

If Char choice is Y
	Bool isFinished stays false
Else
	Bool isFinished change to true

5. Get a random number. If the number is even print “RIGHT”, if it’s odd, print “LEFT”. Do this ten times. Print out how many times it was “LEFT” and how many times it was “RIGHT”.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initialize Integer leftCount
Initialize Integer rightCount
Initialize Integer randomNumber
Initialize Integer amountOfLoops = 10

For i from 1 to amountOfLoops
	randomNumber = RANDOM between 1 and 100

	If randomnumber can be divided by 2 or is equal to 0
		Print to console "Right"
		Add +1 to rightCount
	Else
		Print to console "Left"
		Add +1 to leftCount
Break loop when amountOfLoops is reached

Output to console: "Left: " + leftCount
Output to console: "Right: " + rightCount
